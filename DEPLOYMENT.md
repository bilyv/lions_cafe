## üöÄ Vercel Deployment Fix

This guide explains how to fix the 404 error when refreshing pages on Vercel deployment.

### Problem
When you navigate to routes like `/menu`, `/gallery`, etc., they work fine. But when you refresh the page or directly visit these URLs, Vercel returns a 404 error because it's looking for actual files at those paths, which don't exist in a Single Page Application (SPA).

### Solution
We've implemented the following fixes:

## üìÅ Files Added/Modified

### 1. `vercel.json` (Root directory)
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/service-worker.js",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
          "value": "1; mode=block"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Purpose**: Tells Vercel to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.

### 2. `public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

**Purpose**: Fallback configuration for other hosting platforms.

### 3. Updated `vite.config.ts`
Added proper SPA configuration:
- `historyApiFallback: true` for development server
- Optimized build configuration

### 4. Improved `NotFound.tsx`
- Uses React Router's `Link` instead of anchor tags
- Better error display with the attempted path
- Improved styling and user experience

## üîß How It Works

1. **Client-side routing**: When users navigate within your app, React Router handles the routing without making server requests.

2. **Server-side fallback**: When users refresh a page or directly visit a URL like `yoursite.com/menu`, Vercel receives the request and, instead of looking for a `/menu` file, it serves `index.html` due to the rewrite rule.

3. **React Router takeover**: Once `index.html` loads, React Router reads the current URL and renders the appropriate component.

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add Vercel configuration for SPA routing"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - If connected to GitHub, Vercel will automatically deploy
   - Or manually deploy using Vercel CLI: `vercel --prod`

3. **Test the fix**:
   - Visit your deployed site
   - Navigate to different pages (e.g., `/menu`, `/gallery`)
   - Refresh the page - it should now work without 404 errors
   - Try directly visiting URLs like `yoursite.com/menu`

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed

- ‚úÖ Direct URL access (e.g., `yoursite.com/menu`)
- ‚úÖ Page refresh on any route
- ‚úÖ Browser back/forward buttons
- ‚úÖ Bookmarking specific pages
- ‚úÖ Sharing direct links to pages
- ‚úÖ SEO-friendly URLs

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Clear browser cache** and try again
2. **Check Vercel deployment logs** for any build errors
3. **Verify all files are committed** and pushed to your repository
4. **Test locally** with `npm run build && npm run preview`

## üì± Additional Benefits

The configuration also adds:
- Security headers for better protection
- Proper caching for service workers
- Optimized build configuration for better performance

## üéØ Next Steps

Your SPA routing should now work perfectly on Vercel! Users can:
- Refresh any page without getting 404 errors
- Share direct links to specific pages
- Bookmark any page in your application
- Use browser navigation normally

The fix is production-ready and follows Vercel's best practices for SPA deployment.
